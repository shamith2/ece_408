# ECE 408 : Applied Parallel Programming using CUDA
### MP1: Vector Addition - The purpose of this lab is to implement a simple vector addition kernel
### MP2: Basic Matrix Multiplication - The purpose of this lab is to implement a basic dense matrix multiplication routine
### MP3: Tiled Matrix Multiplication - The purpose of this lab is to implement a tiled dense matrix multiplication routine using shared memory
### MP4: 3D Convulution - The purpose of this lab is to implement a 3D convolution using constant memory for the kernel and 3D shared memory tiling
### MP5.1: List Reduction - Implement a kernel and associated host code that performs reduction of a 1D list stored in a C array. The reduction should give the sum of the list
### MP5.2: List Scan - The purpose of this lab is to implement one or more kernels and their associated host code to perform parallel scan on a 1D list. The scan operator used will be addition
